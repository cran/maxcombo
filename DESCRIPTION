Description: Functions for comparing survival curves using the max-combo test at a single timepoint or repeatedly at successive respective timepoints while controlling type I error (i.e., the group sequential setting), as published by Prior (2020) <doi:10.1177/0962280220931560>.  The max-combo test is a generalization of the weighted log-rank test, which itself is a generalization of the log-rank test, which is a commonly used statistical test for comparing survival curves, e.g., during or after a clinical trial as part of an effort to determine if a new drug or therapy is more effective at delaying undesirable outcomes than an established drug or therapy or a placebo.
